Please follow these guidelines when you have cloned the repository to your computer:

0. Get in contact with me. Communication is key to a successful assignment.
    Add me (Dan Nguyen) on facebook or message me on teams

1. Install the VScode extension gitlens
    - This will allow you to see and compare changes and see its author.
    - This will allow you to easily accept changes if your branch is behind

2. Checkout these following branches specific to the type of development you are doing
    - dev: merge branches into here to check if combined features work
    - shape_display
    - shape_move
    - UAV_display
    - UAV_controls
    - bug_fix

3. Only commit when you have completed a feature!
    - If you accidentally forgot to do something in your commit, you can make changes then
        git add blah.file
        git commit --amend
    - Useful if you also want to change your commit message

4. Push the committed changes into the specific branch if you know it's working.
    - If your branch is behind and you need to push then
        git pull --rebase

5. When we want to combine features from multiple branches, merge them into dev and check if working

6. If working then merge dev into master

7. Don't touch the review branch

8. Talk to me if you want to make any changes to the current approach I have set out
    I am more than happy to consider

Important Concepts

- Polymorphism: Ability of an object to take other forms
    i.e. parent class reference to refer to child class object

- Inheritance: Derive class from another class for a heirarchy of classes

- Composition: Class that references one or more objects of other classes
